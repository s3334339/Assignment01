								<h2>What I enjoy in IT</h2>
								<p>I enjoy both the hardware and software side of IT. My interest in IT is something that has always been with me from childhood, probably coming from my Father's interest in it and that being something I picked up on. During High School I took advantage of my schools IT electives to learn programming as well as learn about the components that go into a PC.</p>
								<h2>Why I am at RMIT</h2>
								<p>I chose to study at RMIT as it provides a good opportunity for me to learn the required skills in Information Technology and I have heard good things about their courses from friends. The initial degree I started was also with RMIT but was a Bachelor of Software Engineering as opposed to my current degree of a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
								<h2>What I expect to learn</h2>
								<p>I expect to learn about how to program as well as how to provide IT services for business. Due to being a General Bachelor of Information Technology I assume it will have focus beyond just a software side of things. There will likely be information provided for communicating the ideas required in the industry to people who are not as knowledgable about IT. It will also help teach about solving issues that arise so that we can appropriately deal with any issues and provide solutions.</p>
