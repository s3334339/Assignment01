								<h2>What is my ideal job?</h2>
								<p>https://www.hcalawyers.com.au/careers/current-available-position-i-t-systems-and-network-administrator/</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This job is for an IT Systems and Network Administrator. The position is about providing the IT systems required for the business, from what the clients interface with to what the internal teams use and what they require. It would also be maintaining their servers and network. I find the idea of maintenance as well as providing solutions for any problems if they arise, or changing systems as required for the job an appealing application of my skill in IT.</p>
								<p>The position asks for a Bachelor Degree or Diploma in IT Communications as the preferred degree/diploma but not as a requirement, as well as having a background within the field.</p>
								<div class="row">
										<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
											<h3>Skills that the position requires:</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Experience in systems and network administration</li>
												<li>Skill with Microsoft Windows Server administration</li>
												<li>Knowledge and experience with important networking and systems concepts</li>
												<li>Experience with virtualisation servers</li>
												<li>Development of a Standard Operating Environment and the deployment of software within that</li>
												<li>Proficiency with Microsoft Office Products</li>

												<li>Knowledge of Android and IOS products</li>
												<li>Expereince with setting up Surface books and Surface notebooks, with both a windows and android operating system</li>

								</div>
								<p>My plan for gaining the skills required is to continue learning through my current degree and then finding a job for more basic position in a IT Team for a business to gain skills as a team member. If there is a specific hole in my skills after doing that, or I need further teaching I would look at doing a more specialised degree while continuing to work in the field.</p>
