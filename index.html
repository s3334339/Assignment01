									<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
									<p>These the tests I have done to determine my personality:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Myers-Briggs test Result: Protagonist - ENFJ-A</li>
										<li><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Education Planner Learning Styles Quiz.</a> Learning Style Test Result: Visual Learner Auditory: 30% Visual: 50% Tactile: 20%</li>
										<li><a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">Mind Tools Creativity Quiz</a> Creativity Score 61</li>
									</ul>
								</header>
								<p>With the parts of the protaginist personality from the Myers-Briggs Test I can identify with the idea that I seek to help other people in my team and I can read how people are feeling. In my previous jobs I have often gone out of my way to assist others when they have needed it and tried to ensure others are clear on it. The learning style test suggests I am a visual learner however I do not think it's quite as simple as claiming you are just one type of learner as while I can see some of the information provided by the test being part of how I learn regarding seeing things it is not completely accurate as some of the tactile tendencies are also important to me. I do think that overall that does provide some guidance for me to stay better focused however. The creativity test has shown me to have creativity as one of my strengths. Reading the analysis of each of the parts it uses to judge creativity does have me agree with most of the analysis about how I have approached workplace issues in the past. I do have reservations about these tests because while they do have some overlap there are other parts I disagree with and I think overall these tests suffer from the same degree of oversimplification of such things, and thus cannot be used for great in depth analysis of any one of these parts.</p>
								<p>Due to what these results have highlighted I think that it will influence how I go about help I offer my teammates. This has helped show me it is one of the places I have the best skill with and thus something I will focus on, along with providing creative solutions.</p>
								<p>When forming the team I think that it will be important to get some people who are good at making a decision in difficult situations as I know that is a weakness of mine that has also been highlighted by the Myers-Briggs Test.</p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
								</header>
								<p>I have the idea for a melee combat game with a linear design. Possibly have basic RPG elements for gaining skills/powers but this would be basic and not over the top. I would like it to not feel too streamlined however I think that having it focused on one thing allows for the best chance of succeeding with what I want. I want the melee combat to feel satisfying and like it has impact, with a focus on caring where the weapon is as opposed to using a simple when you attack there is a hitbox check for range and that says whether you hit or not.</p>
								<p>My reason for having this idea is fond memories of the Jedi Academy games and loving how satisfying the lightsaber combat felt where it mattered where your lightsaber swung, leaving marks on any scenery and where you hit an enemy changed hwo they would be damaged. This is something that has changed for the most part with newer games, seemingly because of the extra complexity most games have. Some more recent games have done a similar kind of thing but in a limited fashion. I there would be interest in having a game that is returning to a more focused idea of that game.</p>
								<p>The biggest focus will be on making the melee combat satisfying and correct. The focus would be on having the hit box for the melee tied to the weapon itself, depending on what the weapons possibly have a different hitbox for a blade versus the shaft/handle. If connecting with scenery this would have an impact, stopping the swing, slowing the swing and damaging the scenery. When it connects with an enemy the damage done to them would change depending on where the swing actually connects, possibly removing a body part or doing more damage depending on the part hit. The idea would be to supply the player with a choice of weapon and having each one function differently. Blunt weapons wouldn't remove limbs and be stopped by connecting with scenery, depending on what the scenery is possibly with smaller or lighter objects being moved or destroyed and still allowing the swing. Bladed weapons would be able to swing through scenery depending on where it hits and what the scenery is, for instance a spear connecting with the shaft would stop similar to a blunt weapon or a connection with a wall would stop it still as you cannot swing all the way through it. Armour that the enemy is wearing would affect the ability for bladed weapons to damage the enemy possibly completely negating it, requiring blunt weapons to be used in their place. The story itself will be linear with one level after the other, possibly having a few places you can choose what order you want to do specific branched parts of the story but requiring you do them all before moving on, and no travelling to the places just doing the missions. I would like the setting to be a sci-fi one as that is not one that has been used for a game of this nature for a while. Using a setting like this would allow more creativity with the weapon and level design, as well as allowing the possibility of things like having some levels having different gravity as you could have things set on different planets, each with its own gravity level. The possible RPG elements I could see including for the game would be along the line of unlocked skills, allowing the use of more advanced moves or combinations, or allowing the use of a more specialised weapon. I wouldn't be doing things like increasing damage because I want that to be based on where and how a melee attack hits instead of giving damage numbers. Due to this the mortality of enemies would be based on limbs lost or damaged and where on the torso they had been damaged. Too many areas damaged meeting a threshold would result in death, with different areas having different values towards that total. The only other thing I would want RPG level wise would be the inclusion of powers the player could get increasing their speed (depending on playability either slowing down the world around them or just causing the player to move faster and swing faster) and possibly greater jump levels.</p>
								<p>I would look at creating this in Unity as it allows the easiest entry into the production of a game. Certain design elements may have to change due to Untiy limitations but it should allow the possibility of creating along the design of this. There would also be the requirement for something to develop 3D assets for the game, Blender, 3DS Max, and Maya being the most prominent choices. As Blender is free that is the most likely choice I would use. Hardware wise it just requires a PC that can handle rendering 3D assets for the game. We would possibly require the hardware for recording sounds, depending on how foley is handled.</p>
								<p>To create this we would need people who are skilled with the use of Unity to code the game. We would also need someone who is skilled with Blender to create assets to be the 3D models in the game. Outside of the actual building of the game it would be necessary to have someone to write the story of the game, even if it is relatively simple to provide motivation for the player to go through the game, as well as someone to do the sound design for the game, either accessing sound libraries or recording it themselves.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful the goal would be to provide the game to people wanting it to play, either for free, a pay what you want, or for a set cost. This is a type of game that has been wanted by some people for a while and if it is appreciated it might allow the development of more similar games, bringing about a greater variety of games in this area. The hope with this game is it would meet the other games of this styles combat and hopefully be a new enough interpretation to surpass them for enjoyability with playing.</p>
